#  How To Play In Casino Machines - Fabet

There are different types of casino machines, and it can be confusing for a first-time player to know how to play them all. Here is a basic guide on how to play the most common casino machines.

The Slot Machine

Slot machines are the most popular casino game in the world, and they are easy to play. To gamble on a slot machine, insert your chosen currency into the machine and pull the lever or press the button. The reels will spin and stop on one or more symbols. If these match any of the winning combinations listed on the machine, you will win money according to the payout schedule.

Poker Machines

Poker machines, also known as "pokies", are similar to slot machines but offer more player interaction. To play a pokie machine, insert your chosen currency and choose how many credits you would like to bet per game. Pressing the button will cause five cards to be dealt face-up onto the screen. You then have a choice of either keeping all five cards (which is usually not wise) or discarding any number of them in order to try and improve your hand. When you are ready, hit the "deal" button and see what happens! If you have the best hand, you winnings will be based on the payout schedule for that particular machine.

Video Poker Machines

 Video poker is a blend of both poker and slot machines, making it perfect for players who want a bit more excitement than just slots can offer. To play video poker, insert your chosen currency into the machine and choose how many credits you would like to bet per game. You will then be dealt five cards face-up. Just like in standard poker, you can keep any number of cards that you like while discarding others in order to try and improve your hand. When you're ready, hit "deal" and see what happens! Your winnings will depend on both the strength of your hand and the payout schedule for that particular machine.
