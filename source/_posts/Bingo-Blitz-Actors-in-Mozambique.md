#  Bingo Blitz Stars in Mozambique

In early November, a team of Bingo Blitz stars arrived in Mozambique to help with hurricane relief efforts. The team, which included Allison Holker, her husband Twitch Boss, and other celebrity friends of the game, spent a week in the country distributing food and supplies to those who had been affected by the devastating storm.

“We’re just so excited to be here and help in any way we can,” said Allison Holker in an interview with local media. “The people of Mozambique have been through so much already, and we’re just happy to be able to bring them a little bit of happiness.”

The Bingo Blitz stars distributed food and supplies to several villages in the area, including Chimoio and Machaze. They also visited a local orphanage, where they distributed clothes, school supplies, and other items to the children living there.

“The children were so excited when they saw us,” said Twitch Boss. “It was great to be able to give them a smile and some hope for the future.”

The team was also able to participate in several relief efforts organized by the local community. They helped clean up debris from the storm, distribute mattresses and other supplies to those who needed them, and paint homes that had been damaged by the storm.

“The people here have been so welcoming and generous,” said Allison Holker. “We feel so lucky to have been able to help out – it really means a lot to us.”
