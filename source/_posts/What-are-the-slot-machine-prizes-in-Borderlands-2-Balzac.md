Borderlands 2 is a video game developed by Gearbox Software and published by 2K Games. It is the sequel to 2009’s Borderlands and was released for the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Microsoft Windows platforms in September 2012. The game is set five years after the events of Borderlands, with Handsome Jack having taken control of the Hyperion Corporation. The player characters are new employees of the company who are sent to capture Handsome Jack.

Players can choose from one of four character classes – Salvador the Gunzerker, Maya the Siren, Axton the Commando, and Zero the Assassin – each with its own unique abilities and skill trees. Weapons and equipment are randomly generated and dropped by enemies, meaning that no two playthroughs are exactly alike.
