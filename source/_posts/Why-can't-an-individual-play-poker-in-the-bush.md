#  Why can't an individual play poker in the bush?

Individuals playing poker in the bush is a pastime that has limitations. The first reason individuals cannot play poker in the bush relates to the cards. Cards that are used in poker, whether they are traditional or online, are designed for gaming in specific areas. The deck and cards used in most casinos around the world have been specifically created for use only in those establishments and as a result, will not be as effective when played in other environments. Outside of a casino, humidity, dust and other particles can quickly damage the cards, making it difficult for players to maintain their hand.

In addition to issues with the cards, another factor that impacts how well poker can be played outdoors is lighting. If attempting to play poker during the day, natural sunlight can interfere with players' ability to see their cards clearly. This issue is exacerbated at night where there is little natural light available and players must rely on artificial light sources which may not be as strong. Finally, weather conditions can also impact how successful someone would be while playing poker outdoors. In windy conditions, cards can easily be blown away or dealt incorrectly while rain can cause slips and falls.

Overall, there are a number of reasons why playing poker outdoors is typically not as successful as it would be in a controlled environment such as a casino or an indoor setting. While some people may be able to overcome some of these limitations, it is likely easier and more enjoyable to play poker indoors where all of these issues have been considered and accounted for.

#  American lawmakers look to restrict online poker

In the United States, lawmakers are looking to restrict online poker. The legislation, which is being championed by Republican Senator Lindsey Graham and Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, would prohibit banks and other payment processors from working with companies that offer online poker.

This is not the first attempt by US lawmakers to restrict online poker. Previous efforts have failed, but supporters of the new legislation are hopeful that this time will be different. One of the main reasons for their optimism is the recent decision by the Department of Justice to overturn a 2011 ruling that concluded that online poker was illegal under federal law.

The new bill has been met with mixed reactions. Supporters argue that it is necessary in order to protect consumers and prevent gambling addiction. Opponents argue that it will stifle innovation and deprive people of a legitimate form of entertainment.

Whether or not the bill will pass remains to be seen. It faces opposition in the Senate and there is no guarantee that it will make it through Congress. Even if it does pass, it is likely to face a legal challenge from the online poker industry.

#  PokerStars: Bush Goldbet players could be at risk

Illegal online poker operator PokerStars, which was acquired by The Stars Group in 2014, is believed to be the target of a new Italian investigation.

According to a report from Reuters, the investigation is looking into whether PokerStars allowed players from the now-defunct Goldbet site to continue playing on its platform after Goldbet's license was revoked in January 2017.

That could see The Stars Group and its Italian subsidiary come up against criminal charges of aiding and abetting gambling offences.

PokerStars declined to comment when contacted by Reuters, while a spokesperson for Italy's financial police said that "the investigations are still ongoing and we cannot provide further information at this stage."

The Stars Group has been no stranger to trouble in Europe recently, with the company recently fined £8 million by the United Kingdom Gambling Commission (UKGC) for failing to protect consumers from being able to gamble with their own money on other websites.

At the time of that fine, UKGC executive director Neil McArthur said that The Stars Group had "failed to keep customers safe by not properly monitoring customer activity across its multiple brands."

#  Nevada and Delaware sign interstate poker pact

Nevada and Delaware have become the latest US states to sign an interstate poker pact, as both look to expand online gambling offerings.

Governor Brian Sandoval of Nevada and Governor Jack Markell of Delaware signed the agreement on Monday, which will see the two states pool player liquidity in order to offer a more varied range of games.

The two states already have a well-established relationship when it comes to online gambling, with Delaware being one of the first US states to legalize online poker in 2012. Nevada followed suit later that year.

Monday’s pact means that players in both states will now be able to compete against each other in a number of different games, including blackjack, roulette and craps.

This is not the first time that the two states have pooled their resources when it comes to gambling – they also teamed up in 2014 to launch a shared online sports betting platform.

Both states are expected to benefit from the new agreement, with Nevada looking to increase its revenue from online gambling and Delaware aiming to bolster its flagging casino industry.

According to analysts, the pact could also pave the way for further cooperation between US states when it comes to online gambling. New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Michigan are all thought to be keen on working together in order to create larger player pools and improve their respective gaming industries.

#  NJ considering legalizing online poker

In the early days of internet poker, New Jersey was one of the most active states in terms of players. But as regulations tightened, many of those players moved offshore to unregulated sites.

Now, the state is considering legalizing and regulating online poker once again.

One big benefit of legalizing online poker is that it could help generate more tax revenue for the state. It’s also seen as a way to combat illegal gambling activity.

There are still some details that need to be worked out, such as the tax rate and which companies would be licensed to offer online poker in NJ. But there seems to be bipartisan support for legalizing it, so it’s likely that something will happen in this area soon.
