#  Exact Number of Gambling Casinos Owned by Chumash Casino Revealed

The Chumash Casino Resort has released the exact number of their gambling casinos. This revelation comes after much speculation about how many locations they operate. The Santa Ynez Band of Chumash Indians, which owns and operates the casino, announced that they have 11 tribal gaming facilities in California.

Ten of these are full-service casinos, while one is a slot machine-only facility. In addition to the main casino in Santa Ynez, there are nine other locations: Santa Maria, Lompoc, Solvang, Buellton, Los Olivos, Santa Barbara (two), Goleta, and Carpinteria. The only exception is the Chumash Casino Resort’s satellite location in Simi Valley which does not offer table games.

The announcement from the tribe also detailed that their 10th full-service casino will be opening soon. It will be in downtown San Luis Obispo on Higuera Street and will feature 240 gaming machines and 14 table games. This new casino is expected to create approximately 400 jobs in the area.

#  Chumash Casino Now Owns 9 Gambling Casinos

On Tuesday, June 12, the Chumash Casino announced that it has finalized the purchase of nine other gambling casinos. This makes the Chumash Casino the largest gambling casino operator in California.

The nine gambling casinos are located in Southern California and Northern Nevada. The Chumash Casino paid $1.7 billion for the casinos, which is a record amount for the sale of U.S. gambling casinos.

In a statement, the Chumash Casino said that it plans to “integrate the new properties into our company as quickly as possible and continue our focus on providing guests with an exceptional experience.”

This acquisition is just the latest in a series of moves by the Chumash Casino to grow its business. In 2017, the Chumash Casino opened a new hotel and spa, and last year it bought the nearby Santa Ynez Band of Chumash Indians’s casino for $130 million.

The Chumash Casino’s move to buy up other gambling casinos is being seen as a response to competition from other large gambling casinos in California, such as Wynn Resorts and MGM Resorts International. These companies have been expanding their operations in California in recent years.

The Chumash Casino currently employs more than 5,000 people and generates more than $600 million in annual revenue. With the purchase of these nine other gambling casinos, it is expected that this number will grow significantly.

#  Chumash Casino Opens 2nd Gambling Casino in 4 Months

In an interesting turn of events, the Chumash Casino has opened up their second gambling casino in the last four months. This new casino is located in Santa Barbara, which is about an hour and a half north of Los Angeles. The original casino is located in Santa Ynez, which is about a half hour north of Santa Barbara.

The timing of this new casino opening is curious, as it comes just a few months after the closure of the Thunder Valley Casino Resort in Lincoln. That casino resort closed its doors in early May, putting over 1,000 employees out of work. It will be interesting to see if this new casino siphons away some of that business.

The Chumash Casino has been pretty busy lately, as they also opened a hotel and spa at the Santa Ynez location earlier this year. The new Santa Barbara casino is a little smaller than the one in Santa Ynez, with around 260 gaming machines and 13 table games.

The casino has been pretty aggressive in its marketing efforts, offering free play days and other promotions to try to lure people in. They are also targeting the local residents, as they are allowed to gamble there without having to drive all the way to Santa Ynez.

With all of the competition in the Southern California gambling market, it will be interesting to see how this new casino does. The Chumash Casino obviously thinks that there is enough business to go around, and they are hoping to steal away some customers from the other casinos in the area.

#  Chumash Casino Increases Its Gambling Casino Portfolio 5x in 3 Years

The Chumash Casino Resort has announced that it has increased its gambling casino portfolio by fivefold in the last three years. The expansion effort, which was spearheaded by CEO Robert Welch, has seen the company invest in new casino properties and gaming technologies in order to better cater to its customers.

The Chumash Casino Resort is one of the largest Native American-owned casinos in the United States. The company owns and operates a number of different casinos, resorts, and hotels across the country. In recent years, however, the Chumash Casino Resort has focused on expanding its gambling casino portfolio.

The expansion began in 2015 with the purchase of the Garden Casino property in Santa Barbara. This was followed in 2017 by the acquisition of the Thunder Valley Casino Resort in Lincoln, California. Earlier this year, the company invested in new gaming technologies, including a virtual reality lounge and a esports arena.

These investments have paid off, with the Chumash Casino Resort seeing a fivefold increase in its gambling casino portfolio over the last three years. This growth is expected to continue in 2019, with the opening of a new $400 million casino property near San Diego.

“Our goal is to provide our customers with an unbeatable gaming experience that can only be found at Chumash Casinos,” said CEO Robert Welch. “We will continue to invest in new casino properties and gaming technologies that will set us apart from our competitors.”
