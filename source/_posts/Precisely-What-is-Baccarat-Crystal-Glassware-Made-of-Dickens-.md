Charles Dickens, one of the most renowned English writers, was born in 1812 and died in 1870. He is mostly known for his novels such as "Great Expectations" and "A Tale of Two Cities".

What many people might not know is that Dickens was an accomplished writer of short stories and essays as well. One of these essays, "The Made-of-All-Sorts" which was published in 1862, is about a man who visits a bazaar to find a new vase for his wife.

He ends up buying a beautiful baccarat crystal glassware vase, but is unsure of its quality. He takes it home and shows it to his wife who says that it is not made of all sorts, but only of glass. The husband insists that it must be made of more than just glass and goes back to the bazaar to ask the merchant what the vase is made of.

The merchant tells him that it is made of all sorts and Dickens then proceeds to tell the story of how each material in the vase was obtained. The glass was made from sand, the metal fittings were made from iron ore, and the silver trimming was made from copper ore. Even the fire that melted down the materials to make the glass was made from coal.

In the end, Dickens concludes that everything in life is made of all sorts and that even if something appears to be simple on the surface, there is usually more than meets the eye. This philosophy can also be applied to baccarat crystal glassware which may appear to be just a simple piece of glassware, but is actually intricately crafted from a variety of materials.

Certain high-quality crystal stemware and bar glasses are generally created from leaded crystal. Leaded crystal is a combination of lead oxide (lead glass) and potassium nitrate. The potassium nitrate prevents the glass from shattering when it is hit or dropped. The lead oxide makes the glass thicker, and increases the clarity, brilliance, and sparkle of the finished product.

Baccarat crystal is a well-known brand of leaded crystal glassware. The company has been producing fine crystal for over 250 years. Some of their most popular products include champagne flutes, wine glasses, martini glasses, and shot glasses.

Baccarat crystal is made from high-quality leaded crystal glass. The lead oxide in the glass makes it thicker and more resistant to chips and cracks than other types of glassware. The clarity, brilliance, and sparkle of Baccarat crystal is second to none.
