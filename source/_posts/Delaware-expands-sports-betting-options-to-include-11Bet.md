#  Delaware expands sports betting options to include 11Bet

Delaware became the latest state to legalize sports betting, with 11Bet among the first companies to offer their services in the state. The news was welcomed by many, as Delaware had previously been one of only two states without any form of legal betting on sports.

11Bet is a UK-based company that has been operational since 2004. The company offers a wide range of betting options for its customers, including traditional sports betting as well as esports and virtual sports. 11Bet also offers a variety of promotions and bonuses for its customers, making it an attractive option for those looking to place bets on sports.

With Delaware now open for business, it is likely that other states will soon follow suit. This is good news for both gamblers and the gaming industry alike, as more states begin to legalize sports betting. It is estimated that the US gambling market is worth some $150 billion annually, so there is certainly room for growth in this area.

For those living in Delaware, there are now a number of different options when it comes to placing a bet on your favorite team or athlete. 11Bet offers a wide variety of bets to choose from, so whether you are looking to bet on the Super Bowl or the World Cup, they have you covered.

Delaware gambling regulators have approved a new online sportsbook which will be operated by the state’s three racetracks.

The sportsbook, which is expected to launch in time for the start of the NFL season, will allow bettors to place wagers on a range of sporting events, including professional and college football, basketball, baseball and hockey.

It will also offer bets on other popular sporting events, such as golf and tennis, as well as major political and entertainment events.

In order to operate the sportsbook, the racetracks have partnered with global gaming technology provider Kambi Group.

Kambi already provides sports betting services to a number of US states, including New Jersey, Pennsylvania and West Virginia.

The company has said that it plans to use its “leading-edge technology” to offer Delaware bettors a “fully immersive experience”.
