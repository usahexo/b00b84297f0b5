<p>The unidentified gambler placed a $1.5 million bet on the New England Patriots to cover the 3-point spread in Sunday’s game against the Atlanta Falcons. The Patriots won 34-28, covering the spread and resulting in a $1.2 million payout for the sports books.</p>
<p>“It was definitely a good weekend,” said John Avello, director of Race and Sports for Wynn Las Vegas. “We had some other big wins, but that one was by far the biggest.”</p>
<p>Avello said it’s not unusual for sports books to take large bets on the Super Bowl, but it’s rare for someone to hit so squarely on the spread. In fact, he estimated that less than 1% of all Super Bowl bets are winners against the spread.</p>
<p>This was not the first big win for Nevada’s sports books during this NFL season. In October, Quicken Loans founder Dan Gilbert won $1 million by betting on the Cleveland Browns to cover the 6-point spread against the Cincinnati Bengals.</p>

The 16 teams will battle it out for the title, with each game providing its own excitement.</p>
<p>To get you prepared for the playoffs, we asked 7stars casino how they think each of the 16 first-round matchups will play out. Here’s their thoughts on all 16 games.</p>
<hr>
<p>Utah Jazz at Oklahoma City Thunder</p>
<p>The Thunder are a heavy favorite to win this series. The Jazz have some good players but they don’t have enough firepower to matchup with Westbrook, George, and Adams. Expect the Thunder to take this series in 4 or 5 games.</p>
<p>7stars casino prediction: Thunder in 4 or 5 games.</p>
<p>Miami Heat at Philadelphia 76ers</p>
<p>The 76ers were one of the biggest surprises of the season and they should be able to carry that momentum into the playoffs. They have a lot of young talent and they’ll be too much for the Heat to handle. The 76ers will win this series in 6 games.</p>
<p>7stars casino prediction: 76ers in 6 games.</p>

<p>The teams that have made it to the playoffs this year are (in order from East to West):</p>

We took a look at each team’s odds and created this bracket:</p>
<h1 id="College-basketball-picks-A-look-at-how-7stars-casino-fared-with-its-predictions"><a href="#College-basketball-picks-A-look-at-how-7stars-casino-fared-with-its-predictions" class="headerlink" title="College basketball picks: A look at how 7stars casino fared with its predictions"></a>College basketball picks: A look at how 7stars casino fared with its predictions</h1><p>The college basketball season is starting to wind down and the NCAA tournament is just around the corner. Naturally, we at 7stars casino decided to take a look back at how our predictions fared.</p>
<p>To start with, we predicted that Michigan State would make it all the way to the final game. While they made it to the Elite Eight, they were ultimately defeated by Duke.</p>
<p>Our other Final Four team – Villanova – also fell short, losing in the second round to Texas Tech. Nonetheless, both Duke and Texas Tech made it all the way to the championship game, with Duke coming out on top.</p>
<p>Moving on to other games, we accurately predicted that North Carolina would win their matchup against Gonzaga while Virginia would lose theirs against Auburn. In addition, we correctly predicted that Kansas would beat Houston and Kentucky would lose to Tennessee.</p>
<p>While there were some misses along the way, our overall record was fairly accurate. With that in mind, make sure to check out our predictions for this year’s NCAA tournament!</p>
<h1 id="MLB-betting-tips-from-the-experts-at-7stars-casino"><a href="#MLB-betting-tips-from-the-experts-at-7stars-casino" class="headerlink" title="MLB betting tips from the experts at 7stars casino"></a>MLB betting tips from the experts at 7stars casino</h1><p>The Major League Baseball (MLB) season is now in full swing, and that means one thing for sports bettors – plenty of opportunities to make profit. Whether you’re new to betting on baseball or a seasoned veteran, our experts at 7stars casino have some tips to help you make the most of your wagers.</p>
<p>First and foremost, it’s important to be well-informed about the teams and players involved. Pay attention to matchups, recent form, injuries and other factors that could influence the outcome of a game. Be selective with your bets – don’t place too many bets on games that are difficult to predict.</p>
<p>Another key factor is to use a reliable sportsbook with good odds. At 7stars casino, we offer competitive odds on all MLB games, as well as a wide range of other sporting events. We also offer a variety of bonuses and promotions, so make sure to check out our website for more information.</p>
<p>Now that you’re armed with some valuable tips, let’s take a closer look at some of the upcoming matchups in the MLB.</p>
<p>The Baltimore Orioles will be taking on the Boston Red Sox this Thursday night, and bookmakers have given the Red Sox a slight edge heading into the game. However, with Chris Tillman taking the mound for Baltimore and Eduardo Rodriguez pitching for Boston, this could be a very close matchup. The Orioles have been playing much better ball lately and could pull off an upset against their division rivals.</p>
<p>On Friday night, it’s Houston Astros vs Seattle Mariners in what should be another close game. The Astros are perennial contenders in the AL West division, while the Mariners are looking to improve upon their surprising 2016 season. With two evenly matched teams going head-to-head, this is definitely one game worth betting on.</p>
<p>Saturday sees two East Coast teams pitted against each other as the New York Yankees take on the Toronto Blue Jays in Toronto. The Blue Jays are currently leading the division with a record of 27-17, while the Yankees are in second place with a record of 23-21. This should be an exciting matchup between two teams with plenty of firepower offensively.</p>
<p>Finally, on Sunday we have another interleague matchup as the National League West division leaders Los Angeles Dodgers take on the Chicago Cubs at Wrigley Field. The Cubs are fresh off winning their first World Series in over 100 years last fall and will be looking to repeat as champions this year. However, they will have their work cut out for them against LA Dodgers ace Clayton Kershaw. This is definitely one game you won’t want to miss!</p>
<p>Whatever your plans are for this weekend’s MLB action, make sure to consult our experts at 7stars casino for advice on where to put your money!</p>
