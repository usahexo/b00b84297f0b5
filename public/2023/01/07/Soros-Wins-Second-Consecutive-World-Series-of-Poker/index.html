            <h1 id="Soros-Wins-Second-Consecutive-World-Series-of-Poker"><a href="#Soros-Wins-Second-Consecutive-World-Series-of-Poker" class="headerlink" title="Soros Wins Second Consecutive World Series of Poker"></a>Soros Wins Second Consecutive World Series of Poker</h1><p>George Soros has won his second consecutive World Series of Poker, taking down the $10,000 buy-in No-Limit Hold’em main event. This is the first time anyone has ever won back-to-back WSOP titles.</p>
<p>Soros started the final table as the chip leader and never relinquished his lead. He eliminated four players on the final table, including bracelet winner Tony Miles in 4th place. His only real scare came when he lost a large chunk of his chips to eventual runner-up Amir Lehavot. However, Soros managed to win a few key hands down the stretch and take home the coveted gold bracelet and $8.3 million first place prize.</p>
<p>Asked about his victory, Soros refused to take all the credit, crediting his team of coaches and support staff for their hard work. “I have an unbelievable team behind me who give me great advice and make sure I’m well prepared for each event,” said Soros. “This victory is as much theirs as it is mine.”</p>
<p>This isn’t Soros’s only recent poker success – he also won two bracelets at this year’s World Series of Poker Europe in Paris. With three bracelets now to his name, Soros is quickly making a name for himself as one of the best poker players in the world.</p>
<h1 id="British-Poker-Star-Storms-to-Second-WSOP-Victory"><a href="#British-Poker-Star-Storms-to-Second-WSOP-Victory" class="headerlink" title="British Poker Star Storms to Second WSOP Victory"></a>British Poker Star Storms to Second WSOP Victory</h1><p>British poker prodigy, 27-year old Jon ‘JohnnyBax’ BaXter, has won his second World Series of Poker (WSOP) bracelet in the $10,000 buy-in HORSE event, taking home the first prize of $522,819.</p>
<p>This was Baxter’s fourth final table appearance of the 2017 WSOP, following two runner-up finishes and a third-place finish. He began the final table as the chip leader and was never seriously challenged, defeating American poker pro David ‘The Dragon’ Pham heads-up to take the title.</p>
<p>“I’m over the moon,” said Baxter after his win. “I’ve had a really good year so far and this is just the icing on the cake. I came into this event really confident and felt like I could go all the way, and that’s exactly what I did.”</p>
<p>Baxter started playing poker at the age of 16 and turned professional in 2013. He is one of Britain’s most successful poker players, with career earnings of over $2.9 million. In addition to his two WSOP bracelets, he has also won two other major tournaments - the 2015 European Poker Tour (EPT) Main Event and the 2016 PokerStars Caribbean Adventure (PCA) High Roller.</p>
<h1 id="American-Poker-Pro-Storms-to-Second-World-Series-Win"><a href="#American-Poker-Pro-Storms-to-Second-World-Series-Win" class="headerlink" title="American Poker Pro Storms to Second World Series Win"></a>American Poker Pro Storms to Second World Series Win</h1><p>In what can only be considered one of the great poker comebacks of all time, American poker pro, John Cynn, stormed to a second World Series of Poker (WSOP) Main Event win this week. He began the final table as the chip underdog but played some inspired poker over the next two days to take down the $8.8 million first prize and the coveted WSOP bracelet.</p>
<p>Cynn’s first big hand at the final table came when he jammed all in with A♣3♠ on a flop of 2♣7♦T♥. His opponent, Tony Miles, called with A♥J♣ and hit a jack on the turn to bust Cynn’s tournament life. However, Cynn battled back and was one of just three players remaining when play halted on Tuesday night.</p>
<p>Heading into the final day of play, Cynn had just over 9 million in chips to his opponent’s 30 million. But Cynn showed no fear and promptly doubled up with K♦Q♦ against Miles’ A♠T♦. The very next hand saw Cynn get all in again with 3♥3♣ against Miles’ Q♦9♦. This time he hit two set outs on the board to dramatically increase his chip stack and take control of the heads-up battle.</p>
<p>A few hands later, it was all over. Miles moved all in with king-high and Cynn called him down with ace-high. The board ran out clean for Cynn and he secured his second WSOP Main Event title - and his first since 2008.</p>
<h1 id="German-Poker-Player-Wins-Second-WSOP-Title-in-a-Row"><a href="#German-Poker-Player-Wins-Second-WSOP-Title-in-a-Row" class="headerlink" title="German Poker Player Wins Second WSOP Title in a Row"></a>German Poker Player Wins Second WSOP Title in a Row</h1><p>Thirty-four-year old German poker player Dietrich Fast has won his second World Series of Poker (WSOP) title in a row, and this time it wasn’t even close.</p>
<p>After starting the final table as the chip leader, Fast ran the table, taking out each of his opponents with relative ease. His heads-up opponent, American poker pro Jesse Martin, was no match for Fast, who quickly dispatched him to take home the $1.5 million prize.</p>
<p>For Fast, this latest win represents a continuation of what has been an amazing year at the poker table. In total, he has now won six tournaments in 2018, including two WSOP bracelets.</p>
<p>When asked about his remarkablewinning streak, Fast credited both his natural talent and his hard work and dedication to the game. “I put in a lot of hours studying and trying to improve my game. That’s really paid off for me lately.”</p>
<p>This is only the second time that a player has won back-to-back WSOP titles; the first time was accomplished by Phil Ivey back in 2005 and 2006. With Fast’s latest win, he has also moved up to third on the all-time money list with over $16 million in career earnings.</p>
<h1 id="Brazilian-Poker-Star-Secures-Second-Straight-WSOP-Victory"><a href="#Brazilian-Poker-Star-Secures-Second-Straight-WSOP-Victory" class="headerlink" title="Brazilian Poker Star Secures Second Straight WSOP Victory"></a>Brazilian Poker Star Secures Second Straight WSOP Victory</h1><p>Defending world champion, João Paulo Simões, has won his second career World Series of Poker (WSOP) title after a dominating performance in the $10,000 Omaha Hi&#x2F;Lo Championship. After starting the final table as the chip leader, Simões never looked back, eliminating each of his opponents to take home the $442,240 first prize.</p>
<p>This is Simões’ second consecutive WSOP victory; he also won last year’s $1,500 Razz event. With this latest win, Simões moves into third place on Brazil’s all-time money list with over $3 million in winnings. </p>
<p>“It feels amazing,” Simões said after the win. “I played really well and had a lot of luck too. I’m really happy to add another title to my resume.”</p>
<p>Simões is perhaps best known for his aggressive playing style which has earned him the nickname “The Lion.” This personality was on full display during the final table as he bluffed and bullied his way to victory. His biggest pot of the day came against Alex Kam Park when he rivers a flush to bust Park and take control of the tournament.</p>
<p>As for Park, he will have to wait until next year to try and capture his first WSOP championship. The runner-up finish is still good for $269,840 and moves him up to sixth on Korea’s all-time money list.</p>
