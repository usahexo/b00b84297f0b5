<h1 id="Borderlands-2-Balzac-What-are-the-best-slot-machine-prizes"><a href="#Borderlands-2-Balzac-What-are-the-best-slot-machine-prizes" class="headerlink" title="Borderlands 2 Balzac: What are the best slot machine prizes?"></a>Borderlands 2 Balzac: What are the best slot machine prizes?</h1><p>Borderlands 2 is a video game developed by Gearbox Software and published by 2K Games. It is the sequel to 2009’s Borderlands and was released for the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Microsoft Windows platforms in September 2012. The game is set five years after the events of Borderlands, with Handsome Jack having taken control of the Hyperion Corporation. The player characters are new employees of the company who are sent to capture Handsome Jack.</p>
<p>The gameplay of Borderlands 2 is very similar to that of the first game, with players fighting off waves of enemies in order to complete missions and earn rewards. Players can choose from one of four character classes – Salvador the Gunzerker, Maya the Siren, Axton the Commando, and Zero the Assassin – each with its own unique abilities and skill trees. Weapons and equipment are randomly generated and dropped by enemies, meaning that no two playthroughs are exactly alike.</p>
<p>One major addition to Borderlands 2 is multiplayer co-operative play, allowing players to team up with friends or other players online to take on the game’s challenges. The game also features a new Badass rank system which rewards players for completing challenges such as killing enemies or finding Easter eggs.</p>
<p>So what are the best slot machine prizes in Borderlands 2? The answer really depends on your preferences as a player. Some people might prefer weapons or ammo packs over character skins or weapon mods, for example. However, there are a few items that stand out as particularly desirable prizes from the slot machines.</p>
<p>The Seraph Crystal is a very sought-after item that can be won from any of the slot machines in Borderlands 2. This valuable crystal can be traded for some of the most powerful weapons in the game, making it extremely valuable to players looking to gear up for end-game content.</p>
<p>Another highly sought-after prize from the slot machines is the Torgue Grenade mod. This powerful grenade mod increases damage dealt by explosions by 300%, making it a must-have for any player looking to deal maximum damage to their enemies.</p>
<p>Finally, one of the most coveted items available from Borderlands 2’s slot machines is the playable headpiece for Zer0, known as “The Mask ofDeath”. This mask allows players to assume the appearance of Zer0’s alternate personality – “the assassin” – which confers bonus damage and critical hit bonuses when equipped. So if you manage to win this rare piece of equipment from a slot machine, count yourself lucky!</p>
