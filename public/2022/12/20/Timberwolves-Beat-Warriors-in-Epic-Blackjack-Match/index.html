            <h1 id="Timberwolves-Beat-Warriors-in-Epic-Blackjack-Match"><a href="#Timberwolves-Beat-Warriors-in-Epic-Blackjack-Match" class="headerlink" title="Timberwolves Beat Warriors in Epic Blackjack Match"></a>Timberwolves Beat Warriors in Epic Blackjack Match</h1><p>Both the Timberwolves and Warriors were looking to get back in the win column Wednesday night. Minnesota played a nearly perfect game, while Golden State struggled with turnovers and poor shooting.</p>
<p>The final score was 117-101 in favor of the Timberwolves. Karl-Anthony Towns led all scorers with 31 points and 17 rebounds. Stephen Curry had 29 points for the Warriors, but it wasn’t enough.</p>
<p>Minnesota’s defense was stifling, forcing 20 turnovers leading to 34 points. The Timberwolves also shot 49 percent from the field, while the Warriors could only muster up 41 percent.</p>
<p>“We just wanted to come in and play hard,” said Towns. “We weren’t really paying attention to the scoreboard. We just wanted to get stops and play together on offense.”</p>
<p>It was a team effort for Minnesota, with six players scoring in double figures. Andrew Wiggins added 23 points, Jamal Crawford had 20, Derrick Rose chipped in 15, Taj Gibson scored 13, and Tyus Jones contributed 10 off the bench.</p>
<p>The victory puts Minnesota at 6-5 on the season and 2-1 against Western Conference opponents. They will next face the Denver Nuggets on Friday night.</p>
<h1 id="Timberwolves-Conquer-Celtics-with-Blackjack-Strategy"><a href="#Timberwolves-Conquer-Celtics-with-Blackjack-Strategy" class="headerlink" title="Timberwolves Conquer Celtics with Blackjack Strategy"></a>Timberwolves Conquer Celtics with Blackjack Strategy</h1><p>The Timberwolves were looking for their first win of the season against the Celtics. The Celtics have been struggling as of late, but with their home court advantage, they were bound to give the Timberwolves a good game.</p>
<p>Both teams started out strong, scoring back and forth in the first quarter. The Celtics jumped out to an early lead, but the Timberwolves managed to close the gap by halftime.</p>
<p>The third quarter was tightly contested, but it was clear that the Celtics were starting to wear down. The Timberwolves took advantage and pulled ahead in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>With their victory, the Timberwolves proved that blackjack strategy can be used to win against even the strongest opponents.</p>
<h1 id="Rubio-Leads-Timberwolves-to-Victory-with-Blackjack-Moves"><a href="#Rubio-Leads-Timberwolves-to-Victory-with-Blackjack-Moves" class="headerlink" title="Rubio Leads Timberwolves to Victory with Blackjack Moves"></a>Rubio Leads Timberwolves to Victory with Blackjack Moves</h1><p>Minnesota Timberwolves (7-4) guard, Ricky Rubio, led the team to a 120-100 victory over the New Orleans Pelicans (3-9) Tuesday evening with some blackjack moves. The Puerto Rican player had 28 points, 14 rebounds and 11 assists in the game - his fourth career triple double.</p>
<p>“Ricky really took control of the game and made some impressive plays,” explained Timberwolves head coach Tom Thibodeau. “He was aggressive on offense and played lockdown defense. His blackjack skills were definitely on display tonight.”</p>
<p>In addition to his stellar stats, Rubio also showcased his blackjack skills by going 5 for 5 at the blackjack table. “I’ve been practicing my blackjack moves a lot lately and it definitely paid off tonight,” he exclaimed after the game. “I think I’m getting pretty good at it.”</p>
<p>Rubio’s teammates were also impressed with his blackjack prowess. “That was some sick moves Ricky was making at the table,” remarked forward Andrew Wiggins. “He’s definitely got a bright future in blackjack.”</p>
<p>With the victory, the Timberwolves improve to 7-4 on the season while the Pelicans fall to 3-9.</p>
<h1 id="Wiggins-Shines-in-Blackjack-Arena-T-Wolves-Win-Again"><a href="#Wiggins-Shines-in-Blackjack-Arena-T-Wolves-Win-Again" class="headerlink" title="Wiggins Shines in Blackjack Arena; T-Wolves Win Again"></a>Wiggins Shines in Blackjack Arena; T-Wolves Win Again</h1><p>The Minnesota Timberwolves have not had an easy season, but they are starting to find their stride as the season winds down. One of the bright spots for the Timberwolves has been sophomore swingman Andrew Wiggins, who has seemingly taken his game to another level.</p>
<p>In the team’s most recent outing against the Sacramento Kings, Wiggins led all scorers with 33 points on an incredibly efficient 14-of-20 shooting. He also tallied five rebounds, four assists and three steals in 38 minutes of action.</p>
<p>This was not an isolated incident; Wiggins has been playing very well over the past month or so. In his last 10 games, he is averaging 24.8 points, 5.3 rebounds and 3.3 assists while shooting 49 percent from the field and 43 percent from three-point range.</p>
<p>This uptick in production can be largely attributed to Wiggins’ growing confidence in his ability to create offense for himself. Earlier in his career, he was often content to defer to teammates or simply take jump shots. However, Wiggins has now realized that he can be a dominant scorer by attacking the basket and using his athleticism to get to the rim.</p>
<p>This newly aggressive mindset was on full display against Sacramento. Early in the game, Wiggins drove baseline and elevated over two defenders for a thunderous one-handed dunk. He followed that up with a three-pointer on the next possession, putting the Kings on notice that he was not going to be stopped easily.</p>
<p>Wiggins’ scoring outburst was particularly impressive given that he was matched up against DeMarcus Cousins for most of the game. Cousins is one of the most dominant big men in the league, yet Wiggins held his own by using his quickness and agility to get around him.</p>
<p>The T-Wolves will need Wiggins to continue playing at this high level if they want to make a playoff run this season. With key players such as Ricky Rubio and Nikola Pekovic sidelined with injuries, Minnesota will need everyone on its roster to step up and contribute.</p>
<h1 id="Timberwolves-Are-Unstoppable-With-Blackjack-steamroll-the-76ers"><a href="#Timberwolves-Are-Unstoppable-With-Blackjack-steamroll-the-76ers" class="headerlink" title="Timberwolves Are Unstoppable With Blackjack; steamroll the 76ers"></a>Timberwolves Are Unstoppable With Blackjack; steamroll the 76ers</h1><p>Led by Karl-Anthony Towns, the Timberwolves have been on a tear lately. In their latest victory against the 76ers, they steamrolled their opponents with a final score of 131-114. The game was close until Towns and Jamal Crawford got going in the second half, opening up an 18-point lead that the Sixers couldn’t overcome.</p>
<p>The key to the Timberwolves’ success has been their lethal combination of Blackjack and basketball. Towns has been playing out of his mind recently, averaging 26 points and 14 rebounds per game over his last five contests. He’s also shooting an impressive 57 percent from the field during that stretch.</p>
<p>Crawford has been a big help as well, averaging 15 points per game in March. He’s been particularly outstanding over the last two games, putting up 37 points against the Suns and 31 against the Sixers.</p>
<p>With both Towns and Crawford playing at a high level, there’s no stopping the Timberwolves. They’ll be a force to be reckoned with in the playoffs this year.</p>
