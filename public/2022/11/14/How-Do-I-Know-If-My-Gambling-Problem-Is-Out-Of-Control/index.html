<h1 id="5-Signs-You-Might-Have-A-Gambling-Problem"><a href="#5-Signs-You-Might-Have-A-Gambling-Problem" class="headerlink" title="5 Signs You Might Have A Gambling Problem"></a>5 Signs You Might Have A Gambling Problem</h1><p>Most people enjoy a casual game of poker or blackjack every now and then, but for some people gambling can become a serious problem. If you’re worried that you or someone you know might have a gambling problem, here are five signs to look out for.</p>
<ol>
<li>You can’t stop gambling</li>
</ol>
<p>If you find yourself continuing to gamble even when it’s causing financial, social or personal problems, there’s a good chance you have a gambling problem. If you feel like you can’t control your urges to gamble, it’s time to get help.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Gambling is taking over your life</li>
</ol>
<p>If gambling is no longer just a hobby but has instead become the focus of your life, that’s another sign that you might have a problem. Are you skipping meals or social events in order to gamble? Are you lying to friends and family about how much money you’ve been spending on gambling? If so, it might be time to seek help.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>You’re borrowing money to gamble</li>
</ol>
<p>One of the most common signs of a gambling addiction is using borrowed money to gamble. This could be money from family and friends, loans from banks or payday lenders, or using credit cards with high interest rates. If you find yourself resorting to this kind of borrowing in order to fund your gambling habit, it might be time for some intervention.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>You experience strong emotions after gambling</li>
</ol>
<p>Do feelings of happiness and elation quickly turn into feelings of sadness and guilt after gambling? If so, there’s a good chance that gambling is causing negative emotions in your life which could be another sign of addiction. Experiencing extreme highs and lows as a result of gambling is not normal behavior and is something that should be addressed.</p>
<h1 id="Can-spouses-tell-if-one-another-has-a-gambling-problem"><a href="#Can-spouses-tell-if-one-another-has-a-gambling-problem" class="headerlink" title="Can spouses tell if one another has a gambling problem?"></a>Can spouses tell if one another has a gambling problem?</h1><p>One of the most common concerns among gambling addicts is whether or not their loved ones can tell that they have a problem. The answer to this question is unfortunately, “Yes, spouses can tell”. In fact, many times partners are the ones who first seek help for the addicted spouse.</p>
<p>There are several signs that may indicate a gambling problem. One of the most obvious is if someone is asking for money frequently or borrowing money from friends and family to gamble with. If someone is secretive about their finances or frequently lies about their gambling activities, this may also be a sign of a problem. Other behavioural changes that might occur include increased irritability, restlessness or secrecy.</p>
<p>Gambling problems often have a significant impact on relationships. Spouses of gamblers often feel neglected and ignored as the addict focuses all their attention on gambling. There is often a lot of resentment and anger built up over time. Financial strains are also common in relationships where one person has a gambling addiction. This can lead to fights and arguments over money matters.</p>
<p>If you think your spouse has a gambling addiction, it’s important to talk to them about it. It can be difficult to face up to the fact that there is a problem, but it’s essential to get help if you want to overcome the addiction. There are many resources available, including support groups and counselling therapies. With the right help, it is possible to overcome a gambling addiction and have a healthy, happy relationship once again</p>
