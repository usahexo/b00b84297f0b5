            <h1 id="Proposed-Ban-on-Online-Gambling-in-Iraq-Threatens-Free-and-Open-Internet"><a href="#Proposed-Ban-on-Online-Gambling-in-Iraq-Threatens-Free-and-Open-Internet" class="headerlink" title="Proposed Ban on Online Gambling in Iraq Threatens Free and Open Internet"></a>Proposed Ban on Online Gambling in Iraq Threatens Free and Open Internet</h1><p>In October of 2017, the Iraqi government proposed a ban on online gambling. The proposed ban would make it illegal to operate or access online gambling websites in Iraq. If passed, the law would have a significant impact on internet freedom in the country and would restrict access to information and entertainment options for Iraqi citizens.</p>
<p>The proposed ban on online gambling is just one of many attempts by the Iraqi government to restrict internet freedom. In recent years, the Iraqi government has made a number of efforts to censor and control the internet. These efforts include blocking websites, ordering telecommunications providers to spy on their customers, and enacting laws that restrict internet freedom.</p>
<p>The proposed ban on online gambling is particularly concerning because it would restrict access to information and entertainment options for Iraqi citizens. Online gambling is a popular activity in Iraq and many people use online gambling websites to gamble recreationally. If the proposed ban is passed, these people will lose access to this form of entertainment.</p>
<p>The proposed ban on online gambling also raises concerns about internet censorship in Iraq. If passed, the law would give the Iraqi government broad powers to block websites and control information. This could lead to further censorship and restriction of freedom of expression in Iraq.</p>
<p>The proposed ban on online gambling is a troubling development for internet freedom in Iraq. It represents another attempt by the Iraqi government to censor and control the internet. If passed, it would have a negative impact on the lives of Iraqi citizens and would restrict access to information and entertainment options.</p>
<h1 id="Opposition-to-Proposed-Online-Gambling-Ban-in-Iraq-Grows"><a href="#Opposition-to-Proposed-Online-Gambling-Ban-in-Iraq-Grows" class="headerlink" title="Opposition to Proposed Online Gambling Ban in Iraq Grows"></a>Opposition to Proposed Online Gambling Ban in Iraq Grows</h1><p>As the Iraqi government moves closer to a proposed ban on online gambling, opposition to the measure is growing.</p>
<p>The proposed bill, which was first introduced in May of this year, would make it illegal for Iraqis to participate in any form of online gambling. The bill has received considerable backlash from citizens and lawmakers alike, with many arguing that it violates the rights of individuals.</p>
<p>Some opponents of the proposed ban have argued that it will do more harm than good. They argue that prohibiting online gambling will only push people towards black market operations, which are much less safe and regulated than legal gambling sites.</p>
<p>Others have raised concerns about the impact the proposed ban could have on the economy. They argue that if people are unable to gamble online, they will spend their money elsewhere, resulting in a loss of revenue for businesses.</p>
<p>So far, there has been no indication as to when the bill might be passed or whether it will even be passed at all. However, the growing opposition to it suggests that it could be facing an uphill battle.</p>
<h1 id="Iraqi-Parliament-Considers-Banning-Online-Gambling"><a href="#Iraqi-Parliament-Considers-Banning-Online-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Iraqi Parliament Considers Banning Online Gambling"></a>Iraqi Parliament Considers Banning Online Gambling</h1><p>Iraq’s parliament is considering a ban on online gambling after complaints from clerics and lawmakers that the practice is un-Islamic and harms society.</p>
<p>Details of the proposed ban are still being worked out, but lawmakers say it would include a prohibition on both online betting and poker games.</p>
<p>“We are studying this matter and we will soon submit a law to prohibit this activity,” said MP Faisal al-Jaroudi. “It is an immoral activity that harms society.”</p>
<p>Some lawmakers have expressed concern that the growing popularity of online gambling is leading to increased rates of addiction and financial problems.</p>
<p>“The people behind this (gambling) are devils,” said MP Majid al-Gharawi. “This is a plague on society.”</p>
<p>Gambling has been illegal in Iraq since 1969, but the advent of the internet has made it easier for people to gamble online. There are no estimates of how many Iraqis engage in online gambling, but lawmakers say the number is growing.</p>
<h1 id="Why-Is-Iraq-Considering-a-Ban-on-Online-Gambling"><a href="#Why-Is-Iraq-Considering-a-Ban-on-Online-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Why Is Iraq Considering a Ban on Online Gambling?"></a>Why Is Iraq Considering a Ban on Online Gambling?</h1><p>The Iraqi government is considering a ban on online gambling as a way to protect its citizens from potential financial harm.</p>
<p>Iraq is one of the top 10 countries in the world when it comes to online gambling activity. This is due, in part, to the fact that there are no laws regulating or banning online gambling in the country.</p>
<p>As a result, many Iraqis have lost money through online gambling. In some cases, people have even mortgaged their homes in order to place bets online.</p>
<p>In light of this, the Iraqi government is now thinking about introducing a ban on online gambling. Officials believe that such a ban would protect its citizens from losing money and becoming indebted to gambling websites.</p>
<p>It is not yet clear how such a ban would be implemented or whether it would be effective in preventing people from gambling online. However, the government is currently exploring ways to make it happen.</p>
<h1 id="Iraqi-Parliament-Mulls-Whether-to-Allow-or-Ban-Online-Gambling"><a href="#Iraqi-Parliament-Mulls-Whether-to-Allow-or-Ban-Online-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Iraqi Parliament Mulls Whether to Allow or Ban Online Gambling"></a>Iraqi Parliament Mulls Whether to Allow or Ban Online Gambling</h1><p>Iraqi lawmakers are mulling a proposal that would allow or prohibit online gambling in the country. The proposed law, which has yet to be approved, was submitted by MP Alia Nassif from the State of Law Coalition bloc.</p>
<p>The draft law would ban online gambling and impose fines and prison sentences for those caught violating the prohibition. It would also create a commission to monitor and enforce the ban.</p>
<p>Nassif argued that online gambling is dangerous and can lead to financial and social problems. She said the proposed law is necessary to protect Iraqi society.</p>
<p>MPs from other blocs have voiced support for the proposed law, with some calling for even tougher penalties for violators.</p>
<p>But some MPs have raised concerns about the potential impact of a ban on online gambling. They argue that such a move could lead to an increase in illegal activity and black market activity.</p>
