<p>The study, conducted by researchers at the University of British Columbia, found that almost two-thirds of problem gamblers who voluntarily enrolled in a casino’s self-exclusion program managed to stay away from the casino for at least six months.</p>
<p>Lead author Dr. Anna Lembke says her team’s findings underscore the importance of self-exclusion programs as an important tool in helping problem gamblers quit gambling.</p>
<p>“Our findings suggest that self-exclusion programs can be a very effective way for problem gamblers to stop gambling,” she said in a statement. “The majority of participants were able to stay away from the casino for at least six months, and many reported feeling better mentally and physically after quitting.”</p>
<p>Casino self-exclusion programs allow people to ban themselves from casinos for a certain period of time or indefinitely. Participants are typically required to provide personal information, such as their name and contact information, which is then shared with casinos in the area.</p>
<p>Lembke and her team analyzed data from nearly 1,000 problem gamblers who enrolled in a self-exclusion program at one of two casinos in British Columbia between 2010 and 2015. Just over 63 percent of participants were able to remain abstinent from gambling for at least six months.</p>
<p>The study also found that many participants experienced positive changes after quitting gambling, including improved physical health, mental health, and financial stability.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-Addicts-Are-More-Likely-To-Quit-If-They-Attend-Rehab"><a href="#Gambling-Addicts-Are-More-Likely-To-Quit-If-They-Attend-Rehab" class="headerlink" title="Gambling Addicts Are More Likely To Quit If They Attend Rehab"></a>Gambling Addicts Are More Likely To Quit If They Attend Rehab</h1><p>Gambling addiction is one of the most difficult addictions to overcome. However, a recent study has shown that gambling addicts are more likely to quit if they attend rehab.</p>
<p>The study was conducted by researchers at the University of Oxford. The researchers analyzed data from more than 3,000 people who had an addiction to gambling. The data was collected over a period of 10 years.</p>
<p>The study found that the odds of recovery for gambling addicts who attended rehab were about twice as high as those who didn’t attend rehab. In fact, only 7% of gambling addicts who didn’t attend rehab managed to recover, compared to 15% of those who did attend rehab.</p>
<p>There are many different types of rehab programs for gambling addicts. Some programs focus on cognitive behavioral therapy, while others focus on medication-assisted treatment.</p>
<p>It’s important to find a rehab program that is tailored to your specific needs. If you don’t feel comfortable with a certain program, it’s important to switch to another program until you find one that feels right for you.</p>
<p>Gambling addiction can be a very difficult addiction to overcome, but the odds of success are much higher if you attend rehab.</p>
<h1 id="25-Of-Gamblers-Successfully-Quit-Gambling-Each-Year"><a href="#25-Of-Gamblers-Successfully-Quit-Gambling-Each-Year" class="headerlink" title="25% Of Gamblers Successfully Quit Gambling Each Year"></a>25% Of Gamblers Successfully Quit Gambling Each Year</h1><p>Around 25% of all gamblers successfully quit gambling each year, according to the National Council on Problem Gambling. This means that one in four people who gamble regularly manage to overcome their addiction and stop gambling altogether. For some, quitting may be a gradual process that takes time and patience, while for others it may be a more sudden decision.</p>
<p>No matter how you achieve it, quitting gambling can be an enormously positive step in your life. It can free up your time and money, improve your mental health, and help you reconnect with loved ones. If you’re struggling with a gambling addiction, here are some steps that may help you quit gambling for good.</p>
<ol>
<li>Admit that you have a problem</li>
</ol>
<p>The first step in overcoming any addiction is admitting that you have a problem. This may be difficult to do, but it’s essential if you want to get better. Gambling addictions can be incredibly secretive, so it may take some time to face up to the fact that you have a problem. But once you do, you’re on your way to getting better.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Seek professional help</li>
</ol>
<p>If you’re finding it difficult to quit gambling on your own, then seeking professional help may be the best option for you. There are many different types of therapy available for problem gamblers, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) or psychoeducation. These therapies can teach you strategies to deal with cravings and problematic thoughts or behaviours around gambling.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Remove yourself from stressful situations</li>
</ol>
<p>If there are certain environments or situations where you tend to gamble more, then try to remove yourself from them as much as possible. This might mean avoiding casino’s or betting shops, or steering clear of social events where alcohol is involved. It can be tough in the beginning, but over time it will become easier and easier not to gamble in these situations.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Don’t keep secrets from loved ones</li>
</ol>
<p>If you have a gambling addiction, it’s important not to keep secrets from loved ones. They can provide support and understanding during your journey to recovery, and they may even be able to offer helpful advice about how best to overcome your addiction. Telling someone about your addiction can feel daunting at first, but it will ultimately be beneficial for both yourself and those close to you.</p>
<h1 id="Most-Gamblers-Who-Quit-Do-So-On-Their-Own"><a href="#Most-Gamblers-Who-Quit-Do-So-On-Their-Own" class="headerlink" title="Most Gamblers Who Quit Do So On Their Own"></a>Most Gamblers Who Quit Do So On Their Own</h1><p>According to a studyconducted by the UK Gambling Commission, the majority of gamblers who voluntarily stop gambling do so without any form of help. The study asked 2,026 individuals who had stopped gambling within the past 12 months how they did it and found that 66 percent of them said they quit on their own.</p>
<p>This probably isn’t too surprising given that most people don’t like to feel like they’re struggling or failing at something. So it makes sense that many would choose to simply stop gambling altogether on their own rather than seek help.</p>
<p>There were a few other findings from the study that were interesting though. For example, 26 percent of those who quit said they did so with the help of a friend or family member, and 9 percent said they got help from a professional such as a counsellor or therapist.</p>
<p>Interestingly, men were more likely than women to say they quit on their own (70 percent vs. 62 percent), while women were more likely than men to say they got help from a friend or family member (29 percent vs. 22 percent). And although overall, older participants were more likely to have received help than younger ones, there was no statistically significant difference between those who received help and those who did not when it came to age group.</p>
<p>So what does all this mean? Well, first and foremost, it shows that most people who successfully quit gambling do so without any outside assistance. This is good news in terms of giving people the option to quitting on their own if they want to, but it’s also important to note that getting help from a professional can be beneficial for some people.</p>
<h1 id="Quitting-Gambling-Is-Hard-But-It’s-Possible"><a href="#Quitting-Gambling-Is-Hard-But-It’s-Possible" class="headerlink" title="Quitting Gambling Is Hard, But It’s Possible"></a>Quitting Gambling Is Hard, But It’s Possible</h1><p>It’s not a secret that gambling can be addictive. For some people, it can be really hard to quit. But it is possible.</p>
<p>If you want to quit gambling, the first thing you need to do is admit that you have a problem. This may be hard to do, but it’s necessary if you want to get help.</p>
<p>Next, you need to find a support group or therapist who can help you deal with your addiction. There are also many self-help books and websites that can teach you how to beat your addiction.</p>
<p>Finally, you need to be willing to commit to quitting gambling. This means making changes in your lifestyle and avoiding any situations that might tempt you to gamble. It won’t be easy, but it’s worth it in the end.</p>
